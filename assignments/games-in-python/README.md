## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create the Hangman Game

#### Description
Write a Python program that implements the Hangman game. The program should randomly select a word from a predefined list and allow the player to guess letters until they either guess the word or run out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the user
- Display the current progress (e.g., _ _ a _ _ _)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display a win or lose message at the end

Example:
```
Word: _ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter: a
Word: _ a _ _ _
Incorrect guesses left: 5
...etc...
```

### 🛠️	Enhance the Game (Optional Challenge)

#### Description
Add extra features to make your Hangman game more fun or user-friendly.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Show letters already guessed
- Allow the player to play again without restarting the program
- Use a larger or themed word list
- Add simple ASCII art for the hangman
